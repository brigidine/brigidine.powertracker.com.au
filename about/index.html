        </h2>
        <p class="big" style="text-align: justify;">
            Powering Change is an initiative that has been designed and built by the staff and students of Brigidine College Randwick, in collaboration with Power Tracker.
            <br> Our mission is to illustrate and analyse the school’s consumption of electricity, and its emission of greenhouse gases. Through this project we hope to raise awareness of the impacts that these consumptions have and, with your help, to try to reduce our overall negative impact on the earth, reduce our energy consumptions and create a better world today and for future generations.
            </p>

            How does the project work?
        </h2>
        <p class="big" style="text-align: justify;">
            The website shows how much electricity we’re using daily, which is then converted into Carbon Dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) emissions. 
            <br>
            We have set a strategic goal to reduce our annual CO<sub>2</sub> output by 5%. We will use our total emissions from 2016 as a baseline and compare this to our total emissions at the end of each year. 
            <br>
            To reach our target we must be aware of our usage. We can monitor this by looking at ‘spikes’ that occur during the day (see Daily Energy usage). If these 'spikes' get smaller every day, then we are reaching our target. 
            <br>
            There are a whole lot of other things you can do to help as well. See the ‘Task List’ after registering for actions you can take at school and home.
            <br>
            Students will be competing with other year groups to see how many actions they can complete. For each action achieved, you will be rewarded points or ‘leaves’. These go to growing your Avatar tree and the College’s overall avatar tree. The harder the challenge, the more points given. Although, everyone will be able to see who has completed what tasks. 
            <br>
            We aim for a combined total of 10,000 leaves by the end of the semester!
